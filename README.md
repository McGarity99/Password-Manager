# Password-Manager
<br />
A simple password generator & password manager command-line application I am developing using C# and the .NET ecosystem. The project is in the conceptual stage at the moment, so this readme will be updated in the near future as I fully define the project goals. For now, the end goal is to have a command-line interface that allows the user to generate passwords and log them under specific labels for easy retrieval later.
